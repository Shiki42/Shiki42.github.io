I am Shuyuan Hu (胡书源), I am currently looking for PhD position in Robotic Learning. Recently, I am interested in how to learn robot skills in uncertain and dynamic environments.

I received my master's degree from the University of Southern California and my bachelor's degree from the University of Leeds. During my master's study, I worked on enhancing the interpretability of computer vision models using graph structures with <a href="https://gyhandy.github.io/" style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr.Yunhao Ge</a> . During my undergraduate study,I conducted research on explainable natural language processing under the supervision of  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5CVB6eYAAAAJ" style="text-decoration: underline;">Prof. Fei Teng</a>.

In my spare time, I like Sci-Fi, Anime, and Skiing.
