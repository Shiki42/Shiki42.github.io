I am a Research Assistant at <a href="https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/en/">Shenzhen AIRS</a>, I am currently looking for PhD position in Robotic Learning. Recently, I am interested in how to learn robot skills in uncertain and dynamic environments.

I received my master's degree from the University of Southern California and my bachelor's degree from the University of Leeds. During my master's study, I worked on enhancing the interpretability of computer vision models using graph structures with <a href="https://gyhandy.github.io/">Dr.Yunhao Ge</a>. During my undergraduate study, I conducted research on explainable natural language processing under the supervision of  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5CVB6eYAAAAJ">Prof. Fei Teng</a>.

In my spare time, I like Sci-Fi, Anime, and Skiing.
