I am currently looking for PhD position in Embodied AI / Robotic Learning. Recently, I am interested in how to learn a generalized 3D representation for manipulation tasks.

I received my master's degree from the University of Southern California and my bachelor's degree from the University of Leeds. During my master's study, I worked on enhancing the interpretability of computer vision models using graph structures with Dr.Yunhao Ge. During my undergraduate study, I researched explainable natural language processing with Prof. Fei Teng.

In my spare time, I like Sci-Fi, Anime, and Skiing.
